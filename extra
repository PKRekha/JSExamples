extra information while working with arrays and objects....

arrays and ojbects are the two important things for iteration for any 
kind of data.

so to iterate we have loops avialble, and hence they are 

-> for loops
-> for of loops
-> map function
-> reduce function
->filter function
-> forEach function
-> every function
->some function
->while loops


for objects we have to iterate usinng 
-> for in loop.

once we iterate using loop , then we will get the data ini array format, 
then we can use any thing from array looping concept.

explination of loops:

map():

map is used to iterate through array and for 
each element in the array it will process and 
gives the result, and there will be call back function 
which will get the result.


filter():
filter is used to iterate through the array, and for each element in 
the array it checks for the 
condition and if the condition meets then it will 
return those array elements as a result
but not the complete array.

reduce():

reduce() is used to iterate through the array, and it contains an 
accumulator, which is assigned as 0 initiallly
after that if we want to get the single object or single result or 
any type of 
calculations, then we can use reduce().

find():

find() is used to find out the first occarance of the element depending
 on the condition.
if even more matches found, still it will return first match, and then 
it will exit the loop.

syntaxes:

var array=[3,5,7,34,65,87,90,'rekha','keerthi','gopi','raghava'];

all loop examples using variouos loop structures: see exampleloops.js program.
